# Desafio QA Estrategia (browser)
## Joao Lira Neto

### About
    This project has a browser automation, and API automation.
    Both developed in Java using the frameworks of Selenium, JUnit, and Cucumber.
    
    The main feature of the browser automation is to check if the price shown in the list view is the same as the price inside the details view.
    For a simple way, the system just uses the "System.out.println()" to list all elements tested. It can be easily outputed to a .pdf, or any other resource.
    
    The API project tests the creation and authentication of a new user, and then the CRUD commands to the projects.

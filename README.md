# Desafio QA Estrategia (browser)
## Joao Lira Neto

### About
    It's a browser automation developed in Java using the frameworks of Selenium, JUnit, and Cucumber.
    The main feature of the project is to check if the price shown in the list view is the same as the price inside the details view.
    For a simple way, the system just uses the "System.out.println()" to list all elements tested. It can be easily outputed to a .pdf, or any other resource.
